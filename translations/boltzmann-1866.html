      On the Mechanical Interpretation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics
    </h1>
    <p>
      The identity of the first law of thermodynamics with the law of the living
      force has long been established; on the other hand, the second law
      occupies a peculiar and exceptional position, and its proofs are carried
      out here and there in ways that are in no way certain and by no means
      straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this treatise then, is to provide of purely analytical,
      completely general proof of the second law of thermodynamics, as well as
      to determine the corresponding mechanical laws.
    </p>

    <h2>Definition of the Concept of Temperature</h2>
    <p>
      Firstly, we must define the central concept in all of thermodynamics,
      which so far has yet to be defined with any clarity and agreement, namely
      the concept of temperature. We would obviously proceed most naturally in
      the spirit of thermodynamics, if we were to first establish the
      experimental definition of temperature then determine which functions of
      the quantities that define molecular motion has such properties, so as to
      be regarded as representing that which is manifest to us in nature as
      temperature. But the first and most necessary requirement for defining
      temperature is that bodies of equal temperature, brought into contact with
      one another do not exchange heat, i.e no vis viva in atomic motion, and we
      have to find the conditions necessary for this equilibrium. For this
      purpose let us consider two bodies that are in contact, which consists of
      atoms with forces acting between them, the intensity of which is generally
      a function of the distance between two atoms. Additionally, the contact
      should be such that no compression or expansion of either body occurs, as
      that would always result in temperature changes and thereby disturb the
      equilibrium of heat; in other words, the pressure should be the same in
      all directions. Let us now specifically examine the interaction of an atom
      of the first body with mass \(m\) and speed \(c\), as well as an atom of
      the second body with mass \(M\) and speed \(C\). We assume the velocities
      of the other atoms are such that on average they neither absorb vis viva
      from the atoms \(m\) and \(M\), nor give it to them, nor do they alter the
      component of the overall motion of the common center of gravity of both
      atoms in any direction; indeed, this must be so if there is to be a
      stability of both bodies in our sense. (For the case where both bodies are
      at rest, the motion of the common center of gravity \(=0\) ; however, it
      is not necessary to introduce this restriction. ) Let us now examine the
      case where the atom \(m\) also does not receive vis viva from \(M\) on
      average; i.e, there is thermal equilibrium between them. It follows from
      our assumption that after a certain time, the start and end of which shall
      be denoted by \(t_1\) and \(t_2\), the sum of the vis viva of both atoms,
      as well as the motion of the common center of gravity in any direction,
      will again assume the same values; so that, if we therefore denote by
      \(v\) and \(V\) the velocities after this time, \(\phi\) and \(\Phi\) the
      angles of the velocities with a straight line \(G\), which for the time
      being is arbitrarily situated in space, \(\theta\) and \(\Theta\) angles
      of the plane passing through \(e\), \(c\), and the straight line \(G\),
      also arbitrarily placed through \(G\), and \(\theta'\) and \(\Theta'\)
      corresponding angles relating to the state after time \( t_2 - t_1\), we
      have the following equations:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[ \frac{mv^2}2 + \frac{MV^2}2 = \frac{mc^2}2 + \frac{MC^2}2 \]
      \[mv\cos\phi' + MV\cos\Phi = mc\cos\phi + MV\cos\Phi \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \[ mv\sin\varphi^\prime\sin\vartheta\ + MV\sin\Phi^\prime\cos\Theta^\prime
      = mc\sin\phi\cos\theta + MC\sin\Phi\cos\Theta\]
