      The determination of the colossal speed with which light travels through
      space is, without doubt, one of the most beautiful results of modern
      astronomy. The ancients believed this speed to be infinite; and their
      perspective in this regard was not, as with so many other questions of
      physics, a mere opinion devoid of evidence; because Aristotle, in
      presenting it, cites in its support the instantaneous transmission of
      daylight. This opinion was later challenged by <em>Alhazen</em>,in his
      <em> Book of Optics</em>, but only through metaphysical reasoning, in
      which <em>Porta</em>, the commentator, who assumes what he calls the
      immateriality of light, also objected with very bad arguments. Galileo
      appears to have been the first, amongst the moderns, to seek to determine
      this speed through experiment. In the first dialogue of the
      <em>Two New Sciences</em>, <em> Salviati</em>, one of the three
      interlocutors, laid out a most ingenious experiment that he had done, and
      that he thought could resolve the question. Two observers, with two
      lights, having placed them close to a distance of a mile apart: one of
      them, at any instant turns off his light; the second covers his light
      immediately when he no longer sees the other; but since the first observer
      sees the second light disappear at the same time as he covers his light,
      Galileo concludes that light is transmitted, in a very small amount of
      time, a distance double the amount that separates the two observers. Some
      experiments similar to this conducted by the members of the
      <em>Accademia del Cimento</em>, but with three times as much distance,
      lead to the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      These experiments, at first glance, seem rather paltry, when we consider
      the grandeur of their objective, but we judge less harshly when we
      remember that around the same time, men such as <em>Lord Bacon</em>, whose
      merits are widely appreciated, believed that the speed of light, like that
      of sound, could be perceptibly altered by the strength and direction of
      the wind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Descartes, whose the system of light has much in common with what we call
      the <em>undulatory system</em>, thought that light was transmitted
      instantaneously to all distances; he further bases this opinion on
      conclusions drawn from the observation of eclipses of the moon. One must
      admit that his rather ingenious argument proves, if not that the speed of
      light is infinite, at least that it is more considerable than all those
      whereby one could be flattered to determine by direct experiment made on
      Earth in the manner of Galileo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frequent eclipses of Jupiter's first satellite, closely following the
      discovery of telescopes, provided Römer with the first demonstration we
      have of the (successive) motion of light. The still imperfect knowledge we
      had of the motion of other satellites, the difficulty of observing their
      eclipses exactly, and some unknown inequalities which, by combining with
      what depended on the motion of light, masked their effects, made them less
      salient and consequently prevented its recognition and caused for some
      time the rejection of Römer's discovery; it was only generally accepted
      when Bradley had shown that this annual motion to which the stars were
      subjected, which is called <em>aberration</em>, depended on the combined
      effect of the motion of light and that of the observer. The speed which we
      had deduced from this phenomenon differed slightly from that which we
      obtained from the eclipses of the first satellite; but the perfection to
      which the <em>Tables</em> were brought, in the works of Laplace, has made
      it possible to revise the first calculations; the constant of aberration
      that M. Delambre has found by the (discussion) of a very large number of
      eclipses of satellites, is absolutely the same as that which Bradley had
      found through his observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first consequence that can be drawn from this remarkable agreement is
      that light moves uniformly, or at least without any perceptible variations
      in the space comprising the orbit of the Earth; the eccentricity of the
      orbit of Jupiter makes it possible to extend this result to the immense
      range it encompasses. It is moreover quite natural to suppose that stars
      of various sizes are unequally distant; and their absolute aberrations,
      deduced from direct observation, are the same. Bradley had concluded that
      the motion of light is uniform at all distances, and that the aberration
      of all celestial bodies can be calculated with the same constant. Some
      astronomers, however, did not accept this result; they suspected that the
      stars of various sizes can emit rays with different speeds, and it must be
      admitted that this idea especially in the emission system, was at the same
      time natural and probable. The direct observation of aberration was hardly
      suited to resolve the question in a decisive manner, since differences in
      speed equal to about 1&frasl; 20 of the speed of light, would produce in
      aberration only a difference of 1'', that one could not hope to surpass,
      even with the help of the best implements; but if we remember that the
      deviation experienced by the luminous rays, penetrating obliquely into a
      diaphanous bodies is a determined function of their incident velocity, we
      see that the total deviation to which they are subject when traversing a
      prism furnishes a natural measurement of their velocity. This method is
      capable of rendering slight inequalities perceptible, because, as it is
      easy to show, a difference of 1 &frasl; 20 produces in the deviations a
      difference of 2' even supposing that we don't utilize a prism with angle
      exceeding 45'. This is also the path I had followed in the experiment, the
      result of which I had the honor of communicating The Class, more than 4
      years ago; luminous rays from various stars, the sun, moon, planets and
      terrestrial lights, had undergone the same deviation, The largest
      discrepancies amounting to 5'', and this number, which is the sum of the
      errors of observation and declination, corresponding moreover only to a
      <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>480</sub> and to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>
      of a second on the aberration; I had concluded from these results that
      light moves with the same speed, no matter the bodies from which it
      emanates, or at least if there are some differences, they cannot, in any
      way, alter the accuracy the accuracy of the astronomical observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since reading my memoir M. Calendreli has published in the Astronomical
      Pamphlets, printed in Rome, some experiments done using this method, and
      which lead him to the same conclusion, except as it regards to sunlight,
      which he attributes to a particular refraction; but I am sure that this
      last result, of which we cannot admit accuracy, is that, when observing
      the stars the Roman astronomer aimed directly at the center of the yellow
      light. While for the sun, as he was forced to observe the edge, he
      pointed, on the contrary, to one of the extreme colors of the spectrum:
      moreover, it would be enough for me to justify, regardless of these
      considerations, the results I have reached, to notice that M. Calendreli
      finds, as well as myself, that the spots on the moon, which we see only
      through reflected sunlight are refracted by precisely the same amount as
      stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see, moreover, that the certainty of the conclusion we make regarding
      the speed of light, from the observations made using prism, is based on
      the supposition that an inequality of speed produces an inequality in the
      deviation, which follows immediately from Newton's explanation of
      refraction; the experiments which I have cited, made me see the
      possibility of demonstrating this principle, but the work on the meridian
      arc had lead me to abandon this research; I have since resumed, subsequent
      to my return, the results of which I will communicate to the Class today.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experiment was almost complete when the reading of one of the beautiful
      memoirs, which Dr. Young has inserted in the Philosophical Transactions,
      informed me that Mr. Robisson, professor of physics at Edinburgh, had
      considered this question of the speed of light theoretically; I have since
      found that it had been examined from different perspectives by Boscowich,
      Michell, Wilson and Blair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before speaking of my observations, I believe I should indicate that the
      experiments of the physicist just cited have not been published in this
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of seeking to measure, by direct experiment, the increase in the
      speed of light rays passing from a rarer medium to a denser medium, must
      have naturally presented itself to a large number of persons; but
      Boscowich is, to my knowledge, is the first who published a reasonable
      experimental test of this idea. This physicist believed that by observing
      the stars through a telescope filled with water, he would find, due to an
      increase in speed acquired by the rays penetrating into this liquid, and
      aberration different from that observed when the space between the object
      and the eyepiece is filled with air. This same circumstance was to bring
      about perceptible changes in the position of terrestrial objects, which
      would thus have been subject to diurnal aberration. He found, for example,
      that a chart located to the south in the winter solstice, would have
      described, in twenty-four hours, a circle with a radius = 5'', and whose
      center corresponds to the average position of the object; but Boscowich's
      reasoning is defective because he forgot to take into account refraction,,
      and consequently of the change in direction that the rays must experience
      by penetrating obliquely from glass into liquid. Adding to that, Mr.
      Wilson, professor of astronomy at Glasgow, who published in the
      philosophical transactions, for the year 1782 a memoir, in which he also
      uses a telescope filled with water as a means of testing the Newtonian
      theory, but arrives at the complete opposite conclusions to those of
      Boscowich; for he has proven that aberration in a similar telescope will
      not be equal to that found in an ordinary instrument, only in the case
      where the velocities in the rare and diaphanous media are in the ratio
      assigned by Newton. Additionally, we can (remark) that the need to apply
      high magnifications to instruments which are intended to discover small
      quantities made Boscowich's telescope useless, since the light of star
      would be, if not totally extinguished, considerably weakened when passing
      through a depth of liquid 3 or 4 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty which presents to us, in attempting to verify Newton's
      theory, results from this principle which is a consequence of it, namely:
      that the speed of light, in any diaphanous medium, must be the same,
      whatever the nature and number places it has previously passed through. It
      can however be observed that when refracting bodies are in motion, the
      refraction experienced by the rays should no longer be calculated with its
      absolute speed, but instead with this speed, increased or decreased by
      that of the body, that is to say the relative speed of the ray; the motion
      we can (imprint) to bodies on Earth, been far too small to meaningfully
      affect the refraction of light, it is necessary to seek in faster moving
      planets, circumstances better suited to render sensitive these refractive
      inequalities. Wilson, had proposed this method to measure the
      translational velocity of the Earth. Dr. Blair, to whom we are indebted
      for his very interesting work on the dispersive forces of liquids,
      believed that the observations had to render perceptible the inequality in
      speeds with which the light rays that reach us from the two edges of
      Jupiter are reflected, because of the rotation of the planet on its axis;
      and Mr. Robisson, in a certain memoir, where he examines this question of
      the speed of light in details, also mentions observations of two edges of
      the rings of Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the means which these distinguished scholars had proposed to
      solve the problems which concerned progress in both physics and astronomy;
      it also follows from the historical summary just given, that they were
      also attached to tracing the path that should be followed to arrive at a
      decisive result, than to undertake observations of which they doubtless
      foresaw great difficulty. I thought it would be important to use the means
      offered by the current state of our knowledge and great precision of our
      instruments, in examining a question whose result may offer us a clue as
      to the true nature of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have endeavored, in my experiment, to make perceptible the differences
      which must result from the translational motion of the Earth, because that
      of our system could, by combining with the former, give rise to rather
      large inequalities. It is, furthermore, natural to suppose that just as
      there are stars of various brightness in the sky, there are also some of
      various sizes, and this circumstance, which I believe was first shown by
      M. Michell, must occasion very-(perceptible) differences in speed of the
      rays that emanate from these various bodies; additionally, this kind of
      experiment allowed me to observe it with a telescope of short focus, while
      it would be essential to use strong magnification to observe inequalities
      of planetary diameters. This method would further require that prisms be
      very perfect, since defects of achromatic defects are proportional to
      magnification. I have already made some test, with the aid of M. Rochon's
      excellent prismatic micrometer, which gave me hope of succeeding; I will,
      while waiting on the results, communicate to the Class the result of the
      first method, which to me seem preferable in all respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we look at an object through a prism, the inequalities of the
      deviation, which arise from changed in speed of the ray, must be all the
      more considerable as the angle of the prism will itself be larger; but
      when we use simple prisms or those formed from a single substance, there
      is, in this respect, a limit we cannot exceed, because, if the angle of
      the prism exceeds 4 or 5 degrees, the edges of the spectrum are diffuse;
      and as the passage from a prismatic color to the neighbouring one is made
      by an imperceptible degradation, one cannot have any certainty, in each
      observation, of pointing to parts of the corresponding spectra; achromatic
      prisms whose angle can be increase at will, are much better able to
      resolving the object I have in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one I used for my first experiment was a prism made of crown-glass and
      one made of flint-glass; the difference in their angles, or the total
      prism angle, was approximately equal to 2.4 degrees. In order to reduce,
      as far as possible, the partial reflections that light always experiences
      at surface separating media of very different densities, I had my two
      prisms glued together with the resin used by opticians to remove polish
      defects on the inner surface of the lenses. The whole prism was [placed],
      in an (unshakable) manner, in a box whose side pins could turn in
      (collars), which made it possible to give the external face an inclination
      which made the image clearest. In order to be sure to observe in the plane
      of the refracting angle, a lateral movement had also been arranged, by a
      mechanism that would be too difficult to describe here; it would be enough
      for me to say that the whole apparatus would be fixed by strong screws to
      the outside cover of the telescope of (mural). Things being thus arranged,
      I measured in the same night, at different times, the (distances) from the
      zenith of a large number of stars; these distances, compared with those
      which one would have observed through the air, gives the deviation which
      the prism causes the luminous rays to experience; from this the following
      tables were constructed:

    <p>
      I then glued together two achromatic prisms, similar to the one that had
      been used for my first experiment; but in order to ensure the results, in
      these new experiments, are independent of the knowledge of the declination
      of star, the collimation error, which can vary with the height of our
      telescope and refraction, I used at different observational method than
      that used in the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new prism, of which I had just spoken, was attached to the telescope
      [on?] a repeater circle, so that half the object was (discovered?), I
      could, by this disposition, sometimes observe through the air, and
      sometimes through the prism: the difference of two heights corrected by
      the motion of the star in the interval between two observations. This
      gives me the deviation without it being necessary to know the absolute
      positions of the star observed. Furthermore, I could start these
      observations a few minutes before the passage of the stars at the
      meridian, repeat them a large number of times to attenuate and at the same
      time point out [division errors]; this is the method use to construct the
      final table:
