	 <h1>A New Law Relating Black Body Radiation to the Second Law of Thermodynamics</h1> 
	 <b> By Willy Wien</b>
<p>
<em>Boltzmann</em> <a href="#ref_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> has demonstrated, using a process devised by <em>Bartoli</em>, that the existence of radiation pressure, exerted upon an irradiated surface, can be deduced from the second law of thermodynamics. This same pressure is also a consequence of the electromagnetic theory of light, and from this Boltzmann could derive <em>Stefan's radiation law</em> for black bodies.
</p>
<p>
 These conclusions can be further generalized, if we do not limit ourselves to the consideration of the total radiation, but also consider each individual component wavelength of the radiation.
</p>
<p> 
The processes which we are to imagine, which are to form the basis of our consideration, ought to correspond to reality, in the same manner as those by <em>Boltzmann</em> and earlier <em>Kirchhoff</em> and <em>Clausius</em>, in that their actual execution must be possible to an seemingly unlimited degree of approximation.
</p>
<p>
As prerequisites, we will first assume the validity of the electromagnetic theory of light, which tells us that the pressure exerted by a ray of light, in the direction that it travels, is equal to the energy of the ray. We also assume the existence of perfectly black and perfectly reflecting bodies, which we can construct in such a manner as to completely scatter the rays of light that they reflect, as is approximately the case for the total reflection from a white body. 
Additionally , we will also consider the second law of thermodynamics to be valid; it states that no work comes about through the radiation which originates from the heat supply of solid bodies, without performing additional work, reducing the temperature or changing the state. 
Finally we assume the applicability of Doppler's principle to rays of light.
</p>
<p>
The radiation emanating from a black body in an enclosed space with reflecting walls will travel in all directions. According to Boltzmann, the average value that corresponds to this condition is obtained through the assumption that in a cube the same amount, i.e. one third of the total radiation, runs parallel to each side wall. A reduction in volume increases the energy density (the amount of energy per unit volume) by compressing the energy into a smaller space and by performing work against the pressure of the rays.
If you reverse this process, the work done will be completely recovered if the speed with which the volume changes are carried out is infinitely small compared to the speed of light,
so that the change in density across the whole enclosure always remains balanced.
</p>
<p>
A process can then be imagined in which an increase in the energy density can be achieved, either through an increase in the temperature, or through a reduction in volume. 
The second law now shows that the energy density taken over the whole spectrum, must be the same as that for each individual wavelength. The wavelength of the radiation under a volume reduction must be changed in accordance with <em>Doppler's principle</em>. The change we calculate can also be caused by an increase in temperature.

<h2> Description of the procedure </h2>
<p>
Let us imagine a cylinder with two movable pistons \(B\) and \(C\). We will assume it has a cross-sectional area of one. The pistons should be fitted with flaps which can be tightly sealed to prevent light from escaping. The enclosures \(1\), \(2\) and \(3\) are completely empty. \(A\) and \(D\) are black bodies of different absolute temperatures \(\theta_1\) and \( \theta_2 \) where \(\theta_2 \gt \theta_1\). They are of such dimensions that their supply of heat is infinitely large compared to heat that is emitted in the form of radiation in the spaces \(1\), \(2\) and \(3\). 
The inner walls of the cylinder, the pistons and the flaps should have the ability to scatter the incident radiation that they reflect, so that there is no longer a preferred direction for the rays.
If we admit perfect mirrors as conceivable, nothing can be said against the possibility that even such bodies, which we describe as completely white, can be produced to arbitrary precision. 
If the two flaps on \(B\) and \(C\) are closed, then the energy of the radiation in enclosure \(2\) is enclosed in a region with insulating walls, and therefore remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
Let's start our process with flap \(B\) opened and \(C\) closed. \(A\) then radiates energy into enclosure \(1\) and \(2\), and \(D\) radiates into enclosure 3. The energy density in \(3\) is greater than in \(2\) because the temperature of \(D\) is higher than that of \(A\). Let \(B\) now be closed. We now push piston \(B\) towards \(C\) at a speed \(v\) that is infinitely small compared to the speed of light \(c\). The energy density in \(2\) will then increase, both by reducing the volume and performing work against the pressure. 
We move \(B\) until the energy density in the enclosures \(2\) and \(3\) are equal. We can then conclude from the second law that the distribution of energy in the spectrum of the rays in both enclosures are the same.
</p>
<p>
If this were were not the case; for instance, if we had rays of a certain wavelength with a greater energy density in enclosure \(3\) than in \(2\), we could place a thin transparent plate in front of flap \(C\), which preferentially lets through the rays of the wavelength in question , and then open the flap.
