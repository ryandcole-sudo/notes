      <h1>Temperature and Entropy of Radiation</h1>
      <p>
        Nearly every kind of radiation can be produced from the heat supplied by
        solid bodies, and contains a finite amount of energy in spaces of finite
        extent, even within the free ether, because the speed of its propagation
        is not infinitely great. It must therefore be subject to the laws of
        thermodynamics, regardless of the source from which it originates. If
        one therefore considers radiation, which is known to be produced only by
        heat, and which is also in thermal equilibrium, then it must be
        thermodynamically completely determined by its volume, energy density
        and its properties, with no dependence on the emitting bodies.
        Additionally, it should be possible to determine the temperature and
        entropy, as soon as a definite quantity of radiation in equilibrium is
        given, for which no further exchange of energy is possible, and for
        which we have also convincingly demonstrated that all the rays can be
        produced by heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very little has to be excluded from these considerations, namely
        Hertzian waves and cathode rays, if these are even waves at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The necessity of these investigations, and the introduction of the
        concept of temperature for radiation has already been pointed out by
        <em>Mr. E. Wiedemann</em> <sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup
        >. Additionally, the radiation which arises from hotter bodies must be
        ascribed higher temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now set ourselves the task of determining radiation only from its
        state, even if it is given to us completely detached from the emitting
        bodies. The possibility for this is offered to us by a corollary of
        Kirchhoff's theorem:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If we completely enclose an empty space with bodies of arbitrary
          nature but finite absorptivity for all rays, and keep the enclosure at
          the same temperature, then the radiation in the cavity, after
          establishing equilibrium, will be the same as if the surrounding walls
          were completely black; it therefore depends only on the temperature
          and not on the nature of the bodies.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        According to this, the radiation of a black body is a state of stable
        thermal equilibrium; any radiation of a different nature is
        automatically converted into that of a black body in such an
        arrangement. As soon as this state has occurred there is no longer any
        exchange of heat between solid bodies and the cavity. Accordingly, we
        must attribute to this radiation the same temperature as to the adjacent
        walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The definition of black body radiation as a state of stable thermal
        equilibrium seems to have considerable advantage over the original one.
        This must assume as possible a body which absorbs all incident rays. The
        physical condition for this however is that the body has the same
        propagation speed for rays of every wavelength as that of empty space, a
        requirement which according to more recent views on dispersion is not
        fulfilled by any body. From these considerations we can treat the
        equilibrium condition as though it came from a perfectly black body.
        This often simplifies the treatment a lot, and we shall refer to them by
        the same name accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Properties of the Equilibrium of Radiation. Perfect and Diffuse Mirrors.
        States of Unstable Equilibrium
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was already deduced by <em>Kirchhoff</em> that black body radiation
        cannot have any preferred direction in relation to the radiating surface
        or polarization. In an earlier work, I deduced the well-known law of
        cosines from this <sup><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup
        >. It follows that this radiation must be produced between two infinite
        planes of the same temperature, and the radiation of each of them yields
        half the radiation present at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the cavity considered above is only partly surrounded by radiating
        surfaces and partly by mirrors, this does nothing to change the energy
        distribution, if the mirrors are perfectly diffuse reflectors. For the
        heated bodies will continue emit energy until every bundle of ray has
        equal energy on both sides. In some cases, this is also true if the
        mirrors reflect perfectly regularly. For example, a rectangular
        parallelepiped is given, where the sidewalls \(ab\) and \(dc\) radiate
        while the others reflect regularly.
      </p>
      <figure id="fig1" style="float: left">
        <img src="img/fig-1.png" alt="figure 1" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 1</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The effect of the sidewalls would then be the same as if a radiating
        surface \(bb'\) were present in place of \(bc\). The resulting sum of
        all reflections is the same as if \(ab\) and \(dc \) were to extend to
        infinity. As we have seen, black body radiation is then produced. There
        is, however, an essential difference, depending on whether the mirrors
        reflect diffusely or regularly, which, incidently, can be rendered in
        such a way that the state is different in the immediate vicinity of the
        radiating bodies and the diffuse mirrors, than at a finite distance from
        these or at the surface of regular mirrors. This is easily recognized if
        one considers that the processes at two neighbouring points of a
        radiating surface or diffuse mirror are completely independent of each
        other. While at a finite distance from these points, all the changes in
        the radiating surface will determine the state,yet a neighbouring point
        at any moment can only receive infinitely little change. In the first
        case a state is represented by a non-differentiable, in the second by a
        differentiable function of position. However, changes in the state of
        equilibrium would not be expressed by functions which would be
        differentiable with respect to time. In the state of equilibrium, both
        types of state would be thermodynamically completely equivalent, because
        they can easily be converted into each other.
      </p>
      <figure id="fig2" style="float: right">
        <img src="img/fig-2.png" alt="figure 2" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 2</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Other equilibrium states can be conceived with different arrangements of
        the mirrors. Let \(ab\) be the average of a circular radiating plane.
        Let a hemisphere be placed around the center of the disk, which should
        perfectly reflect inside. All rays which go out from the body are then
        reflected back to it. In this way, an equilibrium of energy can also
        occur, without the energy density everywhere being that corresponding to
        the radiating plate and the stable equilibrium. This state of
        equilibrium is immediately disturbed as soon as a small part of the
        spherical surface no longer reflects regularly or a foreign body is
        brought into the cavity. Since the equilibrium here can be disturbed
        without an equivalent amount of work, we are entitled to call it
        unstable. Also in this case, the plate \(ab\) could be of any nature, if
        only it had a finite absorptivity for each wavelength at the time of
        production of the radiation, because each bundle of rays coming from
        \(ab\) is reflected back and forth until it is completely absorbed,
        therefore just as much energy must go in the opposite direction. As soon
        as the equilibrium is established, the radiating disk can be replaced by
        a perfect mirror without changing the state of the radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, any other deviation of radiation in equilibrium from that
        of a black body can only be regarded as an unstable equilibrium, since
        it can be converted to the state of stable equilibrium without any
        specifiable work input. If it has any preferred direction, a diffuse
        screen suffices for this purpose; deviations in the color composition
        can be compensated by a radiant body at a temperature corresponding to
        the given energy density without performing any work.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Determination of the Temperature of a Given Equilibrium Radiation.
        Maximum Work Obtainable From Radiation
      </h2>

      <p>
        The heat present in the form of radiation differs from that present in
        solid bodies in that proves to be a mixture of energy of different
        properties, which we can detect by suitable apparatus. These constituent
        parts are independent of each other, because we can produce radiation
        which contains only the individual ones. Thus we are forced to attribute
        the temperature of the entire system to each individual components of
        the radiation of black bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only in this way can we also satisfy the condition that no exchange of
        heat may take place if the temperature is the same. If, for example, we
        have radiation in stable equilibrium, in a closed room with reflecting
        walls, and completely diffuse radiation of a different color composition
        in an adjacent room, equilibrium between the two is only possible when
        they have completely merged, so that every single spectral color has the
        same density in both rooms. The density of each color must be equal in
        order for equilibrium to exist. So we have to attribute the same
        temperature to every single color which occurs in the radiation of the
        black body. To every other spectral color, we must attribute the same
        temperature that a black body would have if it contained that color in
        the same density. For only then could the energy of this color be in
        equilibrium with both. This determination of the temperature is
        unambiguous, because it has only a given color in a certain density.
        Radiation of mixed colors is to be understood in general as a system of
        energy at different temperatures; its transformation into the color
        composition of black body radiation is therefore a balance of these
        different temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are now able to calculate the maximum work that can be obtained from
        a given diffuse radiation, while the [remainder?] changes it color
        composition, assuming we know the energy distribution of the black body
        spectrum. If we plot this distribution graphically, so that the
        wavelengths form the abscissas, the corresponding energy density
        \(\varphi\) the ordinates (so that \(\varphi d\lambda\) is energy
        density of the color between \( \lambda\) and \(\lambda + d\lambda\),
        then the curve obtained must show at least one maximum, because the
        energy vanishes both for \( \lambda = 0 \) and for \( \lambda = \infty
        \). From experiments, we observe only one maximum. We will show later
        that the curves for different temperatures cannot intersect.
      </p>
      <p>
        All spectral colors that we cut from the area enclosed by the curve have
        the same temperature. Let's take a narrow piece of \(a\) on the side
        located from the maximum to the shorter wavelengths. If an equally wide
        piece of \(b\) of shorter wavelengths is cut out, it is obvious that
        this color must have a higher temperature this color will have to be of
        a greater temperature if the ordinate above \(b\) is to have the height
        of \(a\), so if both colors are homogeneous in the same way, the width
        of \(a\) and \(b\) must be a certain part of the wavelengths. Then \(
        \frac ab = \frac{\lambda_a}{\lambda_b} \), where \(\lambda_a\) and
        \(\lambda_b\) denote the corresponding wavelengths. This would require a
        further increase in the temperature of \(b\). Conversely, each color
        between \(a\) and the maximum would have a lower temperature at the same
        density, as well as on the other side of the maximum up to the point
        \(c\) where the temperatures are equal, and which is determined by the
        equation \( c\varphi_c = a\varphi_a \) or \( \lambda_c \varphi_c =
        \lambda_a \varphi_a \). Beyond that point the temperature increases
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(\vartheta_0\) be the absolute temperature at which the density of
        \(b\) equals \(b\varphi_b\) , then during any transformation of the
        color \(b\) into \(a\),which occurs at a constant density, the quantity
        of work is at a maximum.
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ b\varphi_b \frac{ \vartheta_1 - \vartheta_0 }{\vartheta_1} \] This
        follows from the well-known principles of thermodynamics. In this case,
        the color \(a\) has taken on the value
      </p>
      <p>\[ b \varphi_b \frac{\vartheta_0}{\vartheta_1} \] or the value</p>
      <p>
        \[ a\varphi_a \frac{\vartheta_0}{\vartheta_1} \] if we use \(a\) instead
        ,and the minimum amount of work required to transform it radiation into
        radiation of color \(b\) is
      </p>
      <p>
        \[a \varphi_a \frac{\vartheta_1 - \vartheta_0}{\vartheta_1} \] When
        transforming radiation of mixed colors it is necessary to consider the
        changes of each of them. Let \( \varphi_1 ( \lambda) \) be a given
        energy distribution, so that
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \psi = \int\limits_0^\infty \varphi_1 d\lambda \] gives the total
        radiation density. If we transform this into a radiation with the energy
        distribution \( \varphi_2 \left( \lambda \right) \), then for each color
        the (recoverable work?) is
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \varphi_1 d\lambda \frac{\vartheta_1 - \vartheta_0}{\vartheta_1} \]
        where \( \vartheta_0\) results from \( \varphi_2 \left( \lambda \right)
        \)
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the second black body energy distribution for which \(
        \vartheta_0\) is constant, therefore
      </p>
      <div class="equation" id="eq2">
        \[ A = \int\limits_0^\infty \varphi_1 d\lambda - \vartheta_0

        \]

        This is the general equation for the maximum amount of work that can be

      <p>
        Apart from the differences in color, we also have to account for the
        differences in the direction of radiation. We have already seen that for
        black body radiation no preferred direction can exist, but there exist
        states with preferred direction that can keep themselves in equilibrium.
        Numerous conclusions from the laws of refraction and the second law of
        thermodynamics have already been drawn by Mr. <em>von Helmholtz</em> and
        have resulted in important laws for the brightness of rays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us now consider the radiation of a black body as it is produced
        between two infinite radiating planes of the same temperature. Through
        any surface element \(ds\), lying between both planes, an equal amount
        of energy will flow in each direction, regardless of the direction of
        the normal to \(ds\). For if the plane element were itself to radiate,
        the energy emitted would be independent of this direction; but it would
        also have to receive the same amount; it therefore cannot depend on the
        direction either. The direction of the radiation is not influenced by
        whether the medium is completely transparent, partially or totally
        reflective, or radiates. It always radiates energy through a hemisphere
        around its centre point.
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \varepsilon ds \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \int\limits_0^{\frac\pi 2}
        d\gamma d\alpha \sin\alpha \cos\alpha = \pi\varepsilon ds \] where \(
        \varepsilon\) depends only on the temperature of the radiating plates.
        \( \pi\varepsilon\) is then the emissivity of a black body according to
        Kirchhoff's definition. To obtain the energy density, we consider the
        space between the two planes, which may have a distance \(h\). The unit
        surface of each plane emits the energy \( 2\pi\varepsilon d\alpha
        \sin\alpha \cos\alpha \) at the angle \(\alpha\) inclined to the normal.
        Each ray of this direction passes through the length \( \frac
        h{cos\alpha} \) until it is absorbed by the opposing plane.
      </p>
      <p>If \(c\) is the velocity of light, these rays contain the energy</p>
      <p>
        \[ \frac{2\pi\varepsilon d\alpha \sin\alpha \cos\alpha}c \frac
        h{\cos\alpha} \] If we note that the same amount of energy goes back and
        forth, and we divide by the volume, then the density is
      </p>
      <p>
        \[ \psi = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon}c = \frac{4e}c \] If we now consider
        limited cones of rays, e.g. those produced when imaging through lenses,
        it follows from the known theorems that the aperture of cone the rays
        always correspond to the size of the image, so that the narrower cone,
        which belongs to the larger image, includes that much less of the
        emitted rays. If the two images both have the same temperature ,then the
        same amount energy flows back and forth between them. It follows from
        this that the size of the aperture and energy density of the rays in the
        cone corresponds to a temperature, and that for any given cone of rays
        there exist a maximum temperature which can be produced or maintained,
        because with every increase above the maximum, the backwards flow of
        energy predominates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temperature of the radiating body must be attributed to the energy
        which goes back and forth in such a limited pencil of rays, since we can
        concentrate it to produce such a temperature. However, it must be
        presupposed that no dispersion of light occurs on its way. A consequence
        of this determination is that with regular arrangement of the radiation
        direction the energy can posses a high temperature, even if its density
        is much smaller than that of a black body. Therefore, one can produce
        very high temperatures with direct solar radiation, while dispersed
        daylight has a much lower temperature, although both come from the same
        source. If there is an angle of divergence of the rays coming from this
        point of the sphere, then an element \(ds'\) of \(ab\) sends \(ds\) the
        amount of energy \( \varepsilon ds ds' cos^2 \alpha_1 / r^2 \), where
        \(r\) is the distance between \(ds\) and \(ds'\). Now
      </p>
      \[ ds' = \frac{2\pi r^2 \sin\alpha_1}{\cos\alpha_1} d\alpha_1 \] the total
      energy radiated from \(ab\) to \(ds\) is
      <p></p>

        \[ 2\pi\varepsilon ds \int\limits_0^\alpha \sin \alpha_1 \cos \alpha_1
        d\alpha_1 = \pi \varepsilon ds \sin^2\alpha = e ds \sin^2 \alpha \] If
        we want to obtain the energy density near \(ds\), we consider an
        infinitely small rectangular parallelepiped erected above \(ds\) with
        height \(h\), the energy is found to be

        h}c (1-\cos\alpha) \]
      </p>
      <p>
        therefore the density is either \[ \psi_\alpha = \frac{4e}c(1-

      <p>
        allows us to determine the temperature for a given \(\alpha\) and
        \(\phi_\alpha\). It should be noted that the mapping between an object
        and its image can be made arbitrarily small, making this temperature
        valid for any cone of rays. However, the rays must follow a path with
        negligible diffraction. Diffraction always has the effect of scattering
        the direction of the rays, which makes it an irreversible process. When
        \(\alpha\) becomes very small, we approach the case of a basic cone,
        with no rays crossing laterally at a finite distance from the center of
        the sphere. From equation(<a>3</a>), we observe that in this scenario,
        the temperature of a finite density of radiation becomes infinitely
        large compared to the temperature of the black body radiation of equal
        density. The transformation of such regular radiation into that is
        scattered in all directions corresponds to a lowering of the
        temperature, and therefore not readily reversible. However it can serve
        as a compensation for the work obtained from radiation. The maximum work
        can be obtained in a specific direction, with the remaining scattered,
        is given by \( \frac{(\theta_1 - \theta_0)}{\theta_1} \), where the
        value of \(theta\) are to by determined as specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, the radiation has always been assumed to be unpolarized. The
        full effect of polarization can only come into play with rays that have
        very nearly the same direction in a narrow bundle, as we were able to
        achieve at a small angle \(\alpha\) above. Then the influence of
        polarization is such that a polarized beam has the same temperature as
        an unpolarized beam, having twice the density of energy. In fact, a
        linearly polarized beam of rays will pass completely through a suitably
        arranged polarizing prism and fall on a radiating body \(s\), while only
        half of the reciprocal rays of \(s\) travel the path of the polarized
        rays, while the others are directed in a different direction through the
        polarizing prism. Rays of equal polarization, on the other hand, travel
        the same path in both opposite directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted by Mr. von Helmholtz <sup><a>[1]</a></sup
        >, the reciprocity of the ray path ceases as soon as the plane of
        polarization is rotated by magnetic forces. Let parallel light, with
        energy \(q\) per unit time, pass through a Nicol Prism 1, where the
        totally reflected ray is not absorbed but reflected back by a mirror.
        All the apparatus, including the bodies emitting rays, is enclosed in an
        adiabatic cavity. The arrangement can be thought of exactly as Kirchhoff
        conceived in his well-known treatise on the relationship between
        emission and absorption, so it is not necessary to delve further into
        it. The transmitted rays pass through a non-absorbing medium where the
        plane of polarization is rotated by an angle \(\alpha\) due to magnetic
        forces, then continue through a second Nicol prism 2, whose main section
        forms the angle \(\epsilon\) with that of the first. The rays completely
        reflected here should be reflected in the direction of their arrival.
        Then the energy \( \frac q2 (\cos^2(\epsilon - \alpha)) \) passes
        through prism 2, while everything else is reflected. If we now allow the
        same amount of light to enter from the other side with the same
        arrangement. The quantity \( \frac q2 (\cos^2(\epsilon + \alpha) ) \)
        passes through the first prism. Reflections at the boundaries of
        transparent media are disregarded, as these can be arbitrarily reduced
        by a suitable choice of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two bodies of equal temperature would not radiate the same amount of
        heat to each other. The body lying at 1 would receive \[ q - \frac q2 (
        \cos^2 (\epsilon - \alpha) - cos^2 (\epsilon + \alpha )) \]
      </p>
      <p>
        which at 2 is the quantity \[ q + \frac q2 ( \cos^2(\epsilon - \alpha) -
        \cos^2(\epsilon + \alpha ) \]
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference \( q\cos^2(\epsilon - \alpha) - \cos^2 (\epsilon +
        \alpha) \) reaches its greatest value at constant \( \alpha\) when \(
        \epsilon = \frac \pi 4 \). It is then \( q \sin 2\alpha \). For \(
        \alpha = \frac \pi 4 \), 2 then receives three times as much energy as
        1.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we can also use this arrangement to transfer heat from a colder to a
        hotter body, namely when 2 has a higher temperature \(\theta_2\) than
        the temperature \(\theta_1\) of 1. Here we imagine the arrangement in
        such a way that two identical systems, as shown in Fig. 2, are opposite
        each other at a suitable distance, where the radiating bodies have
        different temperatures. Let the bodies be very small, so that the
        divergence angles of the rays reflected by the sphere are small. If we
        now open the spherical surfaces through two segments, the axis of which
        is the line connecting the radiating bodies, we can have the emerging
        rays of one hit the other, while the rays between the lenses run almost
        parallel. The lenses are seen as infinitely thin. If we imagine a
        reflecting spherical surface in place of the body 2, the center of which
        lies in the middle of the lens that lies in front of this body, then all
        rays emanating from 1 will first hit the lens again and thus return to
        1. Using similar devices, we can guide all rays deflected by the
        polarizing prisms back to the starting point. Let \( 2f(\theta_1)\) be
        the energy emanating from 1 in our direction at the time, \(
        2f(\theta_2)\) the energy radiated by 2.
      </p>
      <p>The following is then obtained</p>
      <p>
        2 receives \( f(\theta_1)\cos^2(\epsilon - \alpha) +
        f(\theta_2)\sin^2(\epsilon + \alpha) + f(\theta_2) \)
      </p>
      <p>
        1 recieves \( f(\theta_2)\cos^2(\epsilon + \alpja) +
        f(\theta_1)\sin^2(\epsilon - \alpha) + f(\theta_1) \)
      </p>
      <p>
        2 emits \( 2f(\theta_2)\) in this direction, so it receives the surplus
        \[ U = f(\theta_1)cos^2(\epsilon - \alpha) - f(\theta_2)\cos^2(\epsilon
        + \alpha) \] per unit time
      </p>
      <p>
        and for \(\epsilon = \frac\pi4 \), \[ U = \frac {f(\theta_1)}2 (
        \cos\alpha + \sin\alpha)^2 - \frac{f(\theta_2)}2(\cos\alpha -
        \sin\alpha)^2 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        the quantity of heat \(U\) changes from the temperature \(\theta_1\) to
        \(\theta_2\). In Clausius' terms, this is a negative transformation
        whose transformation value \[ -U(\frac1{\theta_1} - \frac1{\theta_2}) \]
      </p>
      <p>
        vanishes for \(\theta_1 = \theta_2\), on the other hand, with a
        decreasing \(\theta_1\) it must also go through a value of zero, because
        \( f(\theta_1) \) becomes smaller. This quantity must therefore have a
        maximum for a certain value \(\theta_1\). It follows from the equation
        \[ \frac{dU}{d\theta_1} ( \frac1{\theta_1} - \frac1{\theta_2} ) - \frac
        U{\theta_1^2} = 0 \]

      <p>
        As soon as \( f(\theta ) \), \( \theta_2\), \(\alpha\) are given, the
        maximum of the transformation value can be calculated.
      </p>
      <p>
        For \(\alpha = \frac\pi4 \), \( U = f(\theta\) has its greatest value.
        If we also take for \( f(\theta\) Stefan's radiation law, which was
        theoretically established by Boltzmann for the radiation of black
        bodies, namely \( f(\theta) = c\theta^4\), where \(c\) is constant,
        then, since for \( \alpha = \frac\pi4 \) <sup><a>[1]</a></sup
        >, \[ \cos\alpha - \sin\alpha = 0, U = c\theta_1^4 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        The maximum therefore results from the equation \[ \[ 3\theta_1^2 -
        \frac{4\theta_1^2}{\theta_2} = 0, \mathrm{also} \theta_1 = \frac34
        \theta_2 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        The quantity \[ -U (\frac1{\theta_1} - \frac 1{\theta_2} ) \] will be \[
        = - \frac{27}{256} \cdot c \theta_2^3 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this transformation value is negative, it must be accompanied by
        at least an equivalent value. There must be an entropy increase caused
        by the magnet acting on the light. It remains to be seen whether heating
        by itself or simultaneously with the use of the radiation energy serves
        as compensation. The most obvious assumption seems to me to be that
        light destroys the existing magnetization of the medium and transforms
        the magnetic energy into heat.In the case of external, constant magnetic
        forces, this is similar to the way in which the electromotive force
        keeps the lines of electric force constant, which are destroyed
        according to Ohm's law.Since the transformation value increases rapidly
        with increasing \(\theta_2\), such an effect should depend on the
        intensity of the transmitted light. The experiments hitherto have not
        yet been directed at this question.

        The theorems that have so far been established about the magnetic

        The previous observations are independent of any theory of light. They

        From the second fundamental theorem, the conclusion is drawn that
        radiation exerts a pressure on an irradiated surface, and the magnitude
        of this pressure can be calculated if its dependence on temperature is
        known. We would then still remain independent of any hypothesis with a
        large number of possible considerations from the existence of this
        pressure. However, since we know the radiation laws of black bodies
        empirically with very little certainty, it seems to me more reliable to
        assume the electromagnetic theory of light, which allows the magnitude
        of this pressure to be calculated. Also, if the assumption about the
        pressure were different, the conversions could be carried out with the
        greatest of ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Maxwell's theory, a plane wave that falls on the boundary
        of a plane surface and is absorbed, exerts a pressure on the unit area
        that is equal to the energy in the unit volume multiplied by the cosine
        of the angle of incidence. If the plane is reflective, the pressure of
        the reflected wave is added to this. In the case of incident spherical
        waves, the pressure is always calculated from the energy and the
        direction of the wave normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the irradiated surface is subjected to the pressure, the pressure can
        perform work at the expense of the energy of the radiation. Conversely,
        if the surface moves against the incident rays, work must be supplied
        from outside, which increases the energy of the radiation. Let us
        examine the relationship between the radiation and the external energy
        in more detail.

        The process represented here are subject to the general laws of

        In an earlier work, I showed that the flow components of the energy are

      </p>
      <p>
        In forming this expression, by differentiation of \(t\) with respect to
        \(phi\), the quantity \(n\) will appear as a factor. If we substitute
        \(-n\) for \(n), we get system , but with energy flowing backwards.
        Whereas in the first case, the energy value of the system continuously
        increases from the inflow point, in the second it will continuously
        decrease. From this it follows, that as soon as electromagnetic
        oscillations can be produced by means of such an arrangement, the
        principle of least action is fulfilled, states are possible in which,
        conversely, with the same arrangement, the existing energy of
        electromagnetic oscillations can be converted into external work. Such
        oscillations, therefore, which are generated by finite body systems
        cannot occur in thermal radiation, because otherwise, with the same
        system, we could continuously convert the energy of these oscillations
        into work, without compensation, by replacing hot bodies with radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has already been shown, by Mr.Rubens, that by means of alternating
        current machines, which on the one hand produce electric oscillations,
        and on the other hand, convert the energy of the alternating current
        into work, We could produce work from heat with compensation, if
        oscillations of oscillations of corresponding duration were present in
        the radiation. The same result has been derived by me earlier, by quite
        different considerations [1].i By the way, if long electromagnetic waves
        existed, the pressure of radiation itself would allow for the conversion
        of energy into work without compensation. Let us suppose we have
        monochromatic radiation in a closed reflective space, which has the same
        phase on a movable part of the wall; if we enlarge the space, the
        pressure of the radiation performs work, but the compensation for this
        lies in the increase in the volume, which cannot be reversed without an
        equal amount of work. The pressure on the wall cannot be reverse. The
        pressure has half the period of the oscillation, while increases from
        zero to maximum, then decreases back to zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if we could follow the oscillation with the movement of the mirror
        in such a way that, when the pressure is close to zero, we direct it
        towards the radiation, but near the maximum, we let the radiation do
        work, then work will be produced without compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may remain to be seen whether the required velocity of the piston is
        impossible due to the actual thermal radiation, or more likely, the
        apparently secondary, irreversible accompanying phenomena, such as
        friction , receive a great prevalence. In any case, it is evident that
        the wavelength of thermal radiation must not exceed a certain limit.
        Just as the second law of thermodynamics is valid only so long as one
        can attack the motion of the molecules as a whole, so it ceases to apply
        as soon as one is able to act on individual thermal vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we compress the radiation in the manner considered, the question
        arises as to the direction the radiation added by external work. If the
        reflection remains regular during the movement, every point that
        received the waves by reflection from the mirror will receive a lower
        radiation corresponding to the reduction in density, provided that the
        speed at which it moves is infinitely small compared to the speed of
        light, so that the radiation is compensated at any moment. When the
        mirror moves in the opposite direction, a corresponding increase occurs.
        This follows from Huygen's principle as expressed more precisely by
        Kirchhoff [1]. According to this, the state in any point can be regarded
        as originating from from a layer of luminous points spread over the
        reflecting walls. Let us assume the moving wall is flat. Each point
        receives a finite amount of energy from a specific source; if it was
        infinitely small before, it must now still disappear. The increased
        radiation from the movement of the piston therefore follows a regular
        path. Only in this way is the process reversible with regular
        reflection.

      </h2>
      <p>
        In cases where the volume of the enclosed radiation changes, we have to
        distinguish between those in which the radiation is considered to be in
        constant contact with the radiating body, and therefore isothermal with
        a sufficient heat supply from the body, and those in which the
        radiation, separated from the radiating bodies, is enclosed in perfectly
        reflective containers. In the latter case, the color of the radiation
        changes according to Doppler's principle, as I have previously shown
        [1]. If perfectly diffuse radiation is sent back and forth between in a
        rectangular parallelepiped with regular reflecting walls the rays that
        stand out at a certain angle against the normal of the mirror will
        retain this angle even when the volume is reduced.The smaller the angle
        they form with the normal, the more the rays are amplified by external
        energy.In the same way, these rays will also be more affected by the
        change due to Doppler's principle. We then get rays that have different
        colors depending on direction. The change in color and intensity is
        completely reversible.For the latter we have already shown reversibility
        in &sect; 3
      </p>
      <p>
        The change of the color is given by the equation \[ \lambda_1 = \frac{c
        + 2\nu\cos\alpha}c\lambda_0 \] where \(\lambda_0\) is the original
        wavelength, \(\lambda_1\) is the wavelength after reflection from the
        moving mirror and \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\alpha\) is the angle
        between the mirror normal and the ray. If \(x\) is the distance of the
        moving mirror from the opposite wall, then the ray is reflected once
        while the mirror travels the distance \(dx\), where \[ n\frac {dx}{2x}
        \cdot \frac cv \cos\alpha \] If we take \(c\) to be infinitely large
        compared to \(\frac x{dx}\), therefore after a certain time, the
        wavelength is \(\frac{dx}\nu\)
      </p>
      <p>
        [TODO:Equation] In this form, it can be seen that as \( \lambda\)
        recedes, it becomes \(\lambda_0\) again. The energy added by external
        work takes on the color added by each individual oscillation. It simply
        adds itself to the existing ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        If radiation is reflected from diffuse walls, there will be no
        directional preference in color or energy . In such a case, since the
        radiation remains permanently in a state of stable equilibrium, the
        change in color is the same as that caused by a corresponding change in
        temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we have already seen, in arrangements such as those used to create
        (delimited) ray cones, adiabatic changes can also be considered if the
        radiating surface is replaced by a regularly reflecting one. In general,
        the rays do not maintain their direction here. When the radiating
        surface becomes very small, we have an arrangement where all rays fall
        nearly perpendicular to the mirror. In this case, both the color and
        energy change uniformly for all. These processes are also reversible.

        Before we proceed to the calculation of the color change, we must prove
        that in all these cases, the temperature we have defined also has the
        necessary property of being the integrating denominator of the
        differential of the energy supplied. This immediately results in the
        value of entropy. Let us first write the differential of the energy
        supplied in general terms in the form \[ dQ = Mdx + Ndx \] where \(x\)
        and \(y\) the two variables determining the state, \(M\) and \(N\) are
        functions of \(x\) and \(y\), then among the infinite number of
        integrating denominators, there is one distinguished by the fact that it
        is a function of \(x\) and \(y\) alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, it has been shown by <em>Mr. Budde</em> [1] that the absolute
        temperature is the integrating denominator of the heat supplied, being
        only a function of the arbitrarily chosen temperature scale, independent
        of the second determining parameter (e.g. volume). If \(x\) is the
        temperature, then the following condition must be met: \[
        \frac{\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}}N =
        f(x) \] then the integrating denominator determining the temperature is
        \[ D = \mathrm{const}. e^{\int f(x) dx} \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's first consider dispersed radiation from a black body. As we have
        seen the state is entirely determined by the density \(phi\) and the
        volume. If we graphically represent density as ordinate and volume as
        abscissa, then any arbitrary curve can be made of adiabatic and
        isothermal branches by letting them alternate so frequently so that
        segments connect to form curves of any desired approximation. We can
        therefore have any possible value for the density and volume, so they
        can be introduced as independent variables. In this case density becomes
        the temperature variable from which the integrating denominator
        determining the temperature must solely depend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, imagine the radiation in a cylinder with unit cross section. Let \(
        a - x\) be the distance from a movable piston to a fixed base, and \(
        \varphi(a-x) \) is the internal energy of the system, which we denote as
        \(U\). When \(x\) is increased by \(dx\), the volume is reduced, so that
        work is done against the pressure of the rays. According to Boltzmann
        [2] , the average pressure is \( \frac13 \varphi \) per unit area.
        Therefore the work done externally \( -\frac13 \varphi dx = dW \).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Clausius equation \( dQ = dU + dW \) becomes \[ dQ = d\varphi(a-x) -
        \frac43\varphi dx\] Thus equation (6) becomes \[ f(\varphi) =
        \frac1{4\varphi} \] \[ D = c\varphi^{\frac14} = \vartheta \] where \(c\)
        denotes a constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equation (8) expresses <em>Stefan's law</em> of radiation, which was
        already derived from Boltzmann.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entropy \(S\) is given by the equation \[ dS = \frac{dQ}\vartheta \]
        therefore \[ S = S_0 + \frac4{3c}(a-x)\varphi^{\frac34} \]
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now determine the entropy of radiation in a specific direction,
        as seen in the arrangement in Fig. 2. We restrict ourselves to the case
        where the radiating surface is small compared to the radius of the
        sphere. The adiabatic and isothermal volume changes must be carried out
        by expanding and contracting the entire hemisphere, as otherwise the
        most divergent rays would not be reflected. Therefore the radiation must
        not be enclosed between two surfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(r\) be the variable radius of the sphere. If we denote the
        quantity \( \varphi_\alpha r^2 \) as \(\alpha\), then \(\alpha\) is
        constant within the sphere except for the places near the center; we can
        neglect the energy supply there, because the volume increases in the
        third power of the radius, and the density decreases in the square. The
        internal energy is then \[ U = 2\pi\varphi_\alpha\cdot r^3 = 2\pi\alpha
        r \] so [TODO: Equation] therefore
      </p>
      <div>[[TODO: Insert QUITE a FEW EQUATIONS HERE]]</div>
      <p>
        Radiation in a given direction depends on the temperature \(ab\) in the
        same way as diffuse radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on Doppler's principle, we see that the change in diffuse
        radiation in adiabatic process must show the same change in color as
        that brought about by a change in temperature; I computed this change as
        a function of temperature in the aforementioned work by using average
        values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we can make the same calculation for radiation in a given direction
        without having to use averages, because the rays strike the mirror
        nearly perpendicularly and therefore also suffer the same change. The
        number \(n\) of reflections on the moving sphere, while \(r\) changes by
        \(dr\) is given by \[ n= \frac{dr}{2r} \cdot \frac cv \]
      </p>
      <p>The resulting wavelength is therefore [TODO:Equation]</p>
      <p>
        If we set \[ \lambda_n = \lambda + d\lambda \] then [TODO: Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        where \( \alpha \) is the value of \(r\) for \(lambda = \lambda_0 \)
      </p>
      <p>Now for adiabatic changes \(dQ\) is thus [TODO: Equation]</p>
      <p>From this it follows that [TODO:Equation]</p>
      <p>
        Here \( \varphi\alpha' \) corresponds to the value \(r=\alpha ;
        \varphi_\alpha' \) belonging to \(\vartheta\), we get [TODO: Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the same equation I derived using the average value. It follows
        that the energy belonging to a given color also belongs to the new color
        after the change. If the boundaries of a narrow spectral band, taken
        from the normal spectrum, are located at \( \lambda_0 \) and \(
        \lambda_0 + \delta\lambda_0 \) the new boundaries will be at [TODO:
        Equation]
      </p>
      <p>The overall increase in density will be at [TODO:Equation]</p>
      <p>
        As we have seen, it is distributed in such a way that the density of
        each color is increased according to this equation. Let's set [TODO:
        Equation] thus [TODO:Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        Each color \(\lambda_0\) after the change corresponds to a new color
        \(\lambda\) and an ordinate
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the energy distribution in the spectrum of a black body at
        one temperature is known, it can be derived for any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to see that curves of different temperatures must never
        intersect. For if a color corresponding to a lower temperature possessed
        a greater energy density than that of higher temperature, then with the
        help of a surface that preferentially transmits this color, we can
        transfer energy from the lower to the higher temperature, without any
        other change.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of these results, we can give a curve with a slope steeper
        than the long wavelength side of the black body energy distribution
        curve. We start from the equations \[ \lambda\vartheta = \mathrm{const}
        \] , \[ \varphi = \mathrm{const}\vartheta^5 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(\frac{d\varphi}{d\lambda}d\lambda\) be the increase that \(phi\)
        experiences at constant \(theta\) when \(\lambda\) grows by
        \(d\lambda\). On the other hand, as \(\vartheta\) grows by
        \(d\vartheta\), each point of the curve \(\varphi(\lambda)\) moves to
        the side of the smaller \(\lambda\) around the distance [TODO: Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to ensure that the curves \( \vartheta \) and \( \vartheta +
        d\vartheta \) do not intersect, we must have [TODO: Equation]
      </p>
      <p>Now [TODO:Equation] thus [TODO: Equation]</p>
      <p>
        On the side where \( \frac{d\varphi}{d\lambda} \) is negative, i.e from
        the maximum to the longer wavelengths, the limit value is \(
        -\frac{d\varphi}{d\lambda} \) everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each part of this branch of the energy distribution curve must slope
        less than against the abscissa axis than the curve \[\varphi =
        \frac{\mathrm{const}}{\lambda^5}\] for any temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Fig.5 the shape of this curve is drawn, which corresponds to a
        temperature where the maximum of the energy distribution is \[
        \frac{\varphi max}{\lambda max} = 4 \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Having proved that in the reversible changes by which we determined the
        entropy of black body radiation, each spectral color is independent, we
        readily see that the entropy of the radiation of a black body must be
        composed of the entropies of all the individual spectral colors. The
        ratio of the energy and entropy of each color must be a constant for all
        colors: the entropy of the black body monochromatic radiation multiplied
        by the ratio of the energies, thus [TODO: Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        The justification for this decomposition lies in the fact that they have
        the same temperature, and we can calculate the entropy of a heated body
        of uniform temperature into individual parts according to the ratio of
        the available energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        n the case of radiation of composite color, the entropy is then TODO...
        where \(\vartheta\), as we saw above, is to be treated as a function of
        wavelength. From the definition of the radiation of black bodies, we
        were able to conclude that entropy has its greatest value here compared
        to any other color composition. In fact, \[d\mathfrak{T} = 0\] If
        \(\vartheta = \mathrm{Const.} \)
      </p>
      <p>
        When radiation of a spectral color changes into a mixed color, the
        entropy increases and this increase is the compensation for the work
        done. There is a complete analogy for the increase in entropy obtained
        by mixing separated gases. In the case of gases too, the entropy of the
        mixture is equal to the sum of the entropies of the individual gases, as
        if each were present alone. But a difference in the gases allows
        differences in entropy even at the same temperature, while in this case
        we are dealing only with the energy itself, which changes the value of
        the entropy only by differences in its temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The maximum value of the work that can be obtained when a given
        radiation of composition \(\varphi(\lambda)\) passes into the
        composition of black body radiation was according to equation (2)
        [TODO:Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        when determining the radiation entropy in a given direction with
        different color compositions arising by itself.
      </p>

      <h2>Reversible and Irreversible Processes</h2>
      <p>
        From the considerations made so far, we can determine the entropy for
        any given type of ray. The processes involved in increasing and
        decreasing the volume of radiation are reversible when the energy of
        each color does maximum work. We can see from the following observation
        that the radiation pressure with an existing temperature difference
        really gives the greatest work in accordance with
        <em>Carnot's principle</em> only due to the temperature difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we have radiation from black bodies of density \(\varphi_1\) and
        \(\varphi_2 \gt \varphi_1 \) in two right-angled parallelepiped spaces
        with diffuse reflecting walls lying next to each other, then we could
        extract a quantity of work without changing the volume of the entire
        system by letting the partition wall, which we imagine as movable and
        having a unit area, to do work under the downwards pressure \(\frac13
        (\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) until equal pressure is established on both
        sides. Then the temperature is also the same on both sides; let \( b\)
        be the distance of the movable partition from the opposite one in the
        region where \( \varphi_2\) prevails, and let \( \alpha\) be the same
        magnitude in the other regions. The movable partition moves parallel to
        itself until the change in density \( \varphi\) also becomes equal to
        the variable \( \varphi_2' \) \)
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial value of the energy in region 1 is \[ U_1 = \alpha\varphi \]
        during the change [TODO:Equation] likewise [TODO:Equation] also
        [TODO:Equation] The work done during the displacement \(dx\) is
        [TODO:Equation] therefore [TODO:Equation] similarly, [TODO: Equation]
        After the change, it should be [TODO:Equation] and is thus
        [TODO:Equation]
      </p>
      <p>The work gained externally is [TODO:Equation]</p>
      <p>
        If the change in 2 is not adiabatic, but isothermal by connection with a
        radiating body of high heat capacity, then \(\varphi_2'\) remains
        constant \(\varphi_2\), it becomes [TODO:Equation]
      </p>
      <p>
        In this process, the quantity of heat at \( \vartheta_1\) is converted
        into work, while the quantity \(\varphi_1 \alpha
        \frac{\vartheta_2}{\vartheta_1} \) has decreased in temperature from \(
        \vartheta_1 \) to \( \vartheta_2 \). According to the well-known
        theorems of Clausius, the maximum possible work is obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows from these considerations that all the changes in radiation
        are irreversible when radiation increases its volume without work.
        Hence, it follows that the free emission of radiation is an irreversible
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even the mixing of radiation of different colors is irreversible, in
        the same way that mixing two gases without work is irreversible. In both
        cases the entropy increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we allow a diffuse mirror to move freely an enclosure filled with
        black body radiation, then it could be moved without any work, because
        pressure on both sides always remains the same. Consequently, no change
        in color could occur as such a change would require work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The changes in temperature according to
        <em>Doppler's principle</em> balance out in terms of average value at
        the front and back surface, because on average each quantum of energy is
        reflected from the front and back surface an equal number of times. This
        case clearly illustrates how the state demanded by the second law and
        thermal equilibrium is only established on average.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also possible to draw the conclusion, which we already derived
        from other considerations above, that it is not possible to influence
        the energy of individual colors in thermal radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, there cannot be a surface which allows only radiation between two
        specific wavelengths to pass through fully while reflecting all others,
        regardless of direction. If such a surface existed, it could divide
        black body radiation into two parts. Moving the plate would not change
        the color and energy of the transmitted rays, but would influence the
        other rays. Let us choose the plate so that the wavelength \( \lambda =
        a \) and \( \lambda = b \), which delineate the color the transmitted
        energy, lie on the maximum side of the energy distribution curve, where
        the intensity diminishes significantly towards the longer wavelengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \( b \gt a \). On the side of the plate where the radiation is
        compressed, wavelengths outside the range of \(a\) and \(b\) become
        shorter, and the energy of colors with wavelength slightly larger \(b\)
        now acquire wavelengths that fall between \(a\) and \(b\), allowing them
        to freely propagate through space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, in the case of \(\alpha\), the adjacent colors of shorter
        wavelengths will fall between \( a\) and \(b\) in the side of expanding
        radiation and spread through the plate. Since \( \varphi_a \gt \varphi_b
        \), more energy from the side where radiation is expanding would reach
        the other side than vice versa. This excess would add to the already
        excess density caused by compression, and would press against a perfect
        mirror in place of the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you take the path of the plate in the opposite direction with the
        mirror, you would get more work than that used to move the plate, and
        you would also retain a change in color.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can therefore only ascribe to such a lamella the properties that
        <em>Kirchhoff</em> does, namely that it preferentially lets radiation of
        one color through, and preferentially reflects others, but there is
        always a finite ratio between transmitted and reflected rays. Therefore
        the process just described is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can draw another conclusion from a real plate that confirms the
        result obtained above: homogeneous diffuse radiation remains homogeneous
        during an adiabatic change of volume. We saw that the free motion of a
        mirror through the radiation will not affect the color. The compensation
        for the color change must be done for each color separately, according
        to
        <em>Doppler's principle</em>, without the superposition of different
        colors. If this were to occur, then by freely moving a plate that allows
        certain colors to pass through more easily than others, could achieve a
        situation with an overlap of more strongly reflected colors. This would
        result in a change in the color composition. Thus the maximum of the
        energy distribution curve would change more strongly changed, and if
        this was accompanied by an energy exchange with other colors, the
        maximum would give off more energy than it would receive. The
        consequence would be a flattening of the energy distribution curve. If
        on the other hand each color is balanced, it would make no difference
        whether perfect mirrors or semi-transparent surfaces are moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, let's take a look at the various processes in which work is
        done by radiation. The photochemical effects, the generation of galvanic
        current through the illumination of electrodes, the production of
        electric charges under the influence of ultraviolet light as observed by
        <em>Hallwachs and Righi</em>, are examples of such transformation. As
        these experiments are only qualitative, it's not clear whether they
        achieve the maximum possible work.
      </p>
      <p>
        With fluorescence, the color of the incident light is changed. Since
        this involves visible rays, and the maximum energy distribution of black
        body radiation at the intensities which fall on the florescent bodies is
        in the infrared, the entropy decreases towards the more visible rays. If
        florescence follows <em>Stoke's law</em>, i.e the wavelength increases,
        then the process corresponds to an increase in entropy. In substances
        that that behave in the opposite manner, the transformation cannot occur
        without compensation, which is easily account for in simultaneous
        absorption. It follows that florescent substances must change their
        properties at temperatures where they are hot enough to emit visible
        rays. Because if rays of the same temperature fall on them, compensation
        through absorption is no longer possible.
